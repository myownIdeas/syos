                    <h2 class="mt-0"> <span class="text-theme-colored2"></span>What is CBD Used For?</h2>
                    <p  style="text-align: justify;">CBD is one of more than 100 compounds found in the cannabis plant. These compounds are known as cannabinoids and they interact with cell receptors to make up the endocannabinoid system. This is a recently discovered system of a network of cannabis receptors that play an integral part in many psychological functions like sleep, pain, and mood. Researchers think that its main purpose is to help keep our bodies in homeostasis.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="mt-10" style="margin-top:10px;"> <span class="text-theme-colored2"></span>Value</h2>
                    <p  style="text-align: justify;">Although the CBD oil itself can be manufactured synthetically, it is most easily and often harvested from industrial hemp. A member of the cannabis family, industrial hemp contains high amounts of CBD and lower amounts of THC. In the U.S., there are two primary categories of hemp-extracted CBD oil products available: crystalline isolate and full spectrum (whole plant CBD).

You can walk into any pharmacy that carries CBD and purchase it &nbsp;without a prescription so long as the product you are buying has less than 0.3% THC in it. This was made possible with the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill Act.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">The more complicated answer is, “it depends.” I say that because there is a higher strength, &nbsp;purer version of CBD called Epidiolex that has been approved for certain types of seizures. This &nbsp;product made by Greenwich Biosciences is prescription only and only available thru certain specialty pharmacies.&nbsp;</p></div>

                        <hr>
                        <p class="mb-20"><div class="section"> <div class="section-inner"><p class="rteBlock">This is a very common question with a lot of people worried that CBD will interfere with their daily activities and the ability to function effectively. It’s a fact that CBD will not make you feel “high” (or stoned, faded or any other term you care to use) like THC does. CBD is 100% non-psychoactive meaning it does not negatively affect your mind or mental processes. It’s a bit confusing because although CBD and THC come from the cannabis plant, they are both structurally different and interacts with the cannabinoid receptor differently.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">You will find certain products available for sale with THC but this shouldn’t cause an alarm. Such products contain only trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%) and not enough to make you feel high. This combination of high CBD content and extremely low levels of THC is also what makes the products derived from hemp plants non-psychoactive.</p></div>

Both are strains of the same plant with differences in their concentration of CBD, growth pattern, effects on the body, legality, and uses.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">The concentration of CBD: Hemp has a higher CBD content than marijuana. It (hemp) has a &nbsp;long history of being used for both industrial and medicinal purposes.</p><br> <ul class="rteBlock defaultList"><li>Growth pattern: It is unusual for hemp plants to produce flowers all thanks to several years of &nbsp;constant crossbreeding to weed out any undesired psychoactive effect common with cannabis. While in the field, hemp tends to grow faster, taller, and hardier than cannabis plants and may require a controlled growing conditions before producing the desired results.</li><li>Effects on the body: Hemp plants contain no more than 0.3% of THC and thus, does not elicit psychoactive effects. They are safe for consumption and do not show up in drug tests. The marijuana plant has an approximate THC concentration of 30%.</li><li>Legality: Due to the high concentration of THC in the marijuana plant, their use is illegal in several parts of the world. Hemp was recently removed from the list of illegal substances listed under the Controlled substance act of 1970 and Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 thus legalizing all hemp products with not more than 0.3% THC as safe for public usage.&nbsp;</li></ul>

                        <p class="mb-20"><div class="section"> <div class="section-inner"><p class="rteBlock">No. According to Quest Diagnostics Director of Science and Technology, Barry Sample, CBD likely won’t show up on a drug test: “If the product contains only CBD and has had the THC removed, then an individual being tested would not be expected to test positive for marijuana or marijuana metabolite.” In other words, marijuana drug tests screen for THC, not CBD.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">Furthermore, if you are using a full spectrum CBD product that contains 0.3% THC or lower, unless you are using a huge amount at one time it most likely won’t show up on a drug test &nbsp;either. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), &nbsp;the recommended cutoff level of THC is 50 ng/mL to pass a drug test. Most hemp oil or CBD products are usually sold with much lower levels of THC (compared to marijuana), so most CBD consumers won’t have trouble passing a drug test.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">If you want to make certain that you don’t have a chance that THC shows up in a drug test talk &nbsp;to a pharmacist who can recommend a product that is THC-free. Check that by requesting a COA (certificate of analysis) from the company to make certain that the product for a fact has no THC.&nbsp;</p></div>

                        <p class="mb-20"><div class="section"> <div class="section-inner"><p class="rteBlock">This is one of the most important questions to ask your pharmacist. If you are a new customer to the pharmacy be sure to bring a list of all your current medications to have the pharmacist review before using any CBD product. CBD does affect enzymes in the liver that processes certain types of medications. For example, if you are taking a medication where maintaining a certain blood level is critical – such as anti-seizure, anti-viral, or blood thinning medications – talk to your pharmacist for further guidance.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">At low doses of CBD, less than 150mg total per day, it is unlikely that significant drug-herb interactions will occur. Furthermore, there are no absolute contraindications to the use of CBD, &nbsp;rather monitoring is required if you are on certain prescription drugs alongside CBD.&nbsp;</p></div>

At the time of compiling this write-up, the FDA is yet to release an official statement concerning the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of CBD products. I tell my patients to start “low and slow” with a steady increase every day in dosage until you achieve the effect you want. Everybody is different and the range is wide but research suggests a starter dose of 1-6mg of CBD for every 10 pounds of body weight. For instance, an individual weighing 100 lb is expected to start with around 10mg of CBD per day. Start with a low dose for about three evenings and see how your body responds before you increase.&nbsp;</p><br><p class="rteBlock">Furthermore, the key when it comes to CBD is that taking more doesn’t always equal better. The perfect CBD dosage for you will ultimately be determined by a careful consideration of your body mass index, medical conditions (if any) and severity of disease if it is being used as a treatment option.&nbsp;</p></div>

Feelings of tiredness could last for two to six hours, depending on the method of consumption.</li><li>Dizziness: CBD oil may cause a minor drop in blood pressure, resulting in an initial feeling of dizziness or lightheadedness.</li><li>Diarrhea: Diarrhea has been reported as a side effect accompanying high levels of CBD oil. This could be due to either the CBD or the carrier oil that is used. To avoid diarrhea, users are advised to try a different brand, lower their dosage, or choose a different method of taking it.</li><li>Headache: This is one of the more common side effects I see when people first try CBD. If you experience headaches when you use CBD, I recommend stopping the use for a day or lowering the dosage by half and see if the headache returns.

Rasasvada Botanics has a QR code on it’s labels that link to a Certificate of Analysis Lookup Tool on their website. If you are having difficulty finding this information you can always call or email customer support.&nbsp;</p><br> <ul class="rteBlock defaultList"><li>Potency: This deals with the final concentration of CBD in the product. The concentration of the CBD product tends to determine the level of activity displayed by the CBD products. Make sure the CBD you choose to purchase contains as much CBD as will be required for your dosage. The higher the CBD concentration of a product, the lower its dosage.</li><li>Purity: The purity of CBD products can come in the form of broad spectrum, pure isolate, and full-spectrum CBD products. While full spectrum CBD products contain terpenes, essential oils, CBD, and THC mixed in varying proportions, broad-spectrum CBD contains CBD, terpenes, essential oils but not THC. CBD products labeled as Pure CBD isolates contain 100% CBD products.</li><li>Pesticides and other contaminants: CBD may contain contaminants like pesticides which can be toxic to the body. It is highly recommended that you avoid taking CBD products extracted with toxic solvents like hexane, propane, and BHO. Only utilize CBD products extracted with CO2 as this is the cleanest form of CBD products.&nbsp;</li></ul>
